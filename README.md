# C++ Snake Game (Terminal)

A simple Snake-style game built in C++ that runs in the terminal.

# Features
- Real-time movement with A/D keys
- Jump over obstacles with Space
- Random fruit and wall generation
- Win by reaching the fruit (@)

# How to Play
1. Compile with any C++ compiler (Windows-only for now)
3. Use `A` and `D` to move
4. Press `Space` and another letter ('A' or 'D') to jump over walls
5. Reach the fruit to win

# Notes
- Requires Windows (uses `windows.h`)
- I will probably make a point system :)
